# Tak: Racing Code Through Time

This repository documents an in-depth re-creation of the Tak function benchmark, originally published in Acorn User magazine in 1986. The benchmark, which tests recursion efficiency across various programming languages, was revisited and expanded using multiple configurations of Acorn BBC Microcomputer Systems, emulators, and programming languages."
