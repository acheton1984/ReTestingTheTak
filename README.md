# Tak: Racing Code Through Time

This repository documents an in-depth re-creation of the Tak function benchmark, originally published in *Acorn User* magazine in 1986. The benchmark tests recursion efficiency across multiple programming languages and has been revisited and expanded using a range of Acorn BBC Microcomputer systems, emulators, and languages.
