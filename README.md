# Tak: Racing Code Through Time

This repository documents an in-depth re-creation of the Tak function benchmark, originally published in *Acorn User* magazine in 1986. The benchmark, which tests recursion efficiency across different programming languages, was revisited and expanded using various Acorn BBC Microcomputer System configurations, emulators, and programming languages.
